cpu_freq = psutil.cpu_freq(percpu=True/False)

(percpu: bool = False) -> scpufreq
Return CPU frequency as a namedtuple 
including current, min and max frequency expressed in Mhz.

If *percpu* is True and the system supports per-cpu frequency retrieval (Linux only) a list of frequencies is returned for each CPU. 
If not a list with one element is returned.

***(function) def cpu_times(percpu: bool = False) -> Any
Return system-wide CPU times as a namedtuple. 
Every CPU time represents the seconds the CPU has spent in the given mode. 
The namedtuple's fields availability varies depending on the platform:

user
system
idle
nice (UNIX)
iowait (Linux)
irq (Linux, FreeBSD)
softirq (Linux)
steal (Linux >= 2.6.11)
guest (Linux >= 2.6.24)
guest_nice (Linux >= 3.2.0)
When *percpu* is True return a 
list of namedtuples for each CPU.
 First element of the list refers to first CPU,
  second element to second CPU and so on.
 The order of the list is order of the list is consistent across calls.
